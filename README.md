# Shell User Interactions

_A collection of shell scripts that help implement user interactions like asking for confirmation or notifying that a longer operation is taking place and the user has to be patient._

With the offered reusable commands, these typical interactions can be dealt with in a consistent way and with more powerful functionality than when this is re-implemented over and over again.
